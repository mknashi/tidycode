# Ignore build artifacts but keep the generated WASM module files
# These are needed for production builds on platforms without Rust

# Keep these files:
# - file_ops_wasm.js
# - file_ops_wasm.d.ts
# - file_ops_wasm_bg.wasm
# - file_ops_wasm_bg.wasm.d.ts
# - package.json

# Ignore intermediate build files
